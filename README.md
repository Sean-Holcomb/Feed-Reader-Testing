# Feed Reader Testing
Project 6 for Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. For this project I was given a RSS feed reader and asked to write tests for it using the JS testing framework Jasmine.

## How to run
1. Download Repository
2. Open Index.html
3. Jasmine should run tests and all should pass except the final suite, which is for a functionality that is not yet implemented.

## Addition Functionality.
I have writen tests for a most popular system. When a user clicks on an item its counter gets incremented. This allows for a most popular feed, In which the articles with the most clicks are listed in decending order.
